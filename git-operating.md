## 删除远程仓库的方法
克隆远程仓库到本地库：git clone http文件
对需要删除的文件：git rm test.txt  (删除文件)
文件夹：git rm -r test/    (删除文件夹）
提交修改：git commit -m "提交信息"
将修改提交到远程仓库:git push

Please move or remove them before you merge.
>Aborting
* You can try command to clear the untracked files from the local
git clean  -d  -fx ""
where -d can be replace with following:
-x means ignored files are also removed as well as files unknown to git.
-d means remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
-f is required to force it to run.

>How to ignore error on git pull about my local changes would be overwritten by merge?>Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge
What if I want to overwrite them?
I've tried things like git pull -f, but nothing works.
To be clear, I only want to overwrite specific changes, not everything.
* If you want remove all local changes from your working copy, simply stash them:
git stash save --keep-index
If you don't need them anymore, you now can drop that stash:
git stash drop
If you want to overwrite only specific parts of your local changes, there are two possibilities:
Commit everything you don't want to overwrite and use the method above for the rest.
Use git checkout path/to/file/to/revert for the changes you wish to overwrite. Make sure that file is not staged via git reset HEAD path/to/file/to/revert.
或者git checkout HEAD^ file/to/overwrite
git pull
