Such fluctuations may be, and often are, based on "fundamental" conditions that is, on real changes in the dividend prospects of the stocks affected or on variations in the earning power of the corporations represented and again they may not.

He will get the best results by keeping his eye single to two things : Facts and Prices.

But the following summary may be useful to the active trader: 
(1) Your main purpose must be to keep the mind clear and well balanced. Hence, do not act hastily on apparently sensational information; do not trade so heavily as to become anxious ; and do not permit yourself to be influenced by your position in the market. 
(2) Act on your own judgment, or else act absolutely and entirely on the judgment of another, regardless of your own opinion. "Too many cooks厨子 spoil the broth高汤." 厨子多了烧坏高汤
(3) When in doubt, keep out of the market. Delays cost less than losses. 
(4) Endeavor to catch the trend of sentiment. Even if this should be temporarily against fundamental conditions, it is nevertheless unprofitable to oppose it.

 Most of them are taken by surprise and could raise the money necessary to carry their stocks if they had a little time; but in the stock market, "time is the essence of the contract," and is the very thing that they cannot have. 
The great cause of loss in times of panic is the failure of the investor to keep enough of his capital in liquid form. He becomes "tied up" in various undertakings so that he cannot realize quickly. He may have abundant property, but no ready money. This condition, in turn, results from trying to do too much greed, haste, excessive ambition, an oversupply of easy confidence as to the future. 

It is noticeable in panic times that a period arrives when nearly every one thinks that stocks are low enough, yet prices continue downward to a still lower level. The result is that many investors, after thinking that they have "loaded up" near the bottom, find that it was a false bottom, and are finally forced to throw over their holdings on a further decline. 
This is due to the fact mentioned above, that final low prices are the result of necessities, not of opinions. In 1907, for example, every one of good sense knew perfectly well that stocks were selling below their value the trouble was that investors could not get hold of the money with which to buy.
